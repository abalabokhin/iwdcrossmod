@0    = ~Quite th' sword arm ya bear, bladesman. You'd strike fear in th' hearts o' the most battle-hardened Tempusians on th' battlefield.~ [C0BLANK]
@1    = ~Ha! No higher praise for a warrior than from a faithful of the Foehammer. I thank you for your words, Battleguard.~
@2    = ~Had you th' fire o' yer younger days, I'd sooner wrassle with a mountain giant than face you. Condonin' my drunkenness for blasphemin', but whose god should I thank that we're on the same side, eh?~
@3    = ~You are asking me what patron I worship, aye? Well, I dare not say I am overtly pious, but I have found the teachings of Eldath suit me well.~
@4    = ~Eldath th' Green Goddess, eh? S'pose that puts our dogmas on th' opposite sides o' the room, but the Eldathyn ain't strictly our foes. You'd not take offense to an offer for drinkin' together an' sharing stories, warrior to warrior, eh?~
@5    = ~Not at all. I am no stranger to war in all its forms, and I do not begrudge you for your faith in it, my friend. Quite the contrary, in fact. I would enjoy knowing your perspective.~
@6    = ~Ah, if we're to match wits on th' philosophy of battle, I'll need more than my usual share o' ale first. Four pints, at least. When I'm drunk out o' my wits, I'll talk about anythin'. Now, though, I'd prefer to find a battle than talk about it.~
