@0    = ~You are somewhat like Barovian boars. Not exactly subtle... in any way.~
@1    = ~Hah! I'll take it as a compliment!~
@2    = ~It's not a compliment, but... *sigh* have it your way.~
@3    = ~The more I look at you, the more I wander if vampires would even dare to taste you.~
@4    = ~Wouldn't it be quite a risk? You must be suffering from all sort of diseases. Many of them could be sexually transmitted. So who knows, perhaps your blood would be just as problematic as your affection...~
@5    = ~The only thing I transmit sexually, is pleasure. Even if I can be quite rough sometimes, hahaha!~
@6    = ~Ah. Well, now I wish I have never brought this up.~
