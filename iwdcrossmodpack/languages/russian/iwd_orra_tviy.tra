@0    = ~Eh... T'viy, could you *please* stop scratching my backpack with these claws of yours?~
@1    = ~T'viy will scratch whatever he wants. And I will destroy if I feel like it. DESTRUCTION is the key! DESTRUCTION in the ANSWER.~
@2    = ~YOU should accept it.~
@3    = ~No, I will not accept that some... insane gnome wants to destroy my belonging. I'm not sure why should I even try to tolerate this.~
@4    = ~Because what T'viy is blessed with TRUE BLINDNESS.~
@5    = ~Eh... I'm not even sure why do I even talk to you. Reasoning with you is like trying to convince the sun to become the moon.~
