@0    = ~Another tall MAGE. Pff... at LEAST you're scrawny. T'viy won't need to dig a wide tunnel if we DECIDE to go underground.~
@1    = ~Scrawny? I mean... why would we go underground. We're not dead. And we don't need to dig tunnels? Can't we just... take a normal path or use some bigger, existing tunnel?~
@2    = ~I... I have so many questions.~
@3    = ~YOU ask TOO MANY of them. And... perhaps you DO NOT understand the beauty of the earth. Mmm. A PITY you are not BLIND to pointless things. A PITY you are more like THEM.~
@4    = ~Okay... sorry?~
@5    = ~Mmm. I HOPE you will become BLIND, mage! T'viy would show you the earthy WOMB many of the skeletons you call have ALREADY FOUND.~
@6    = ~Well, I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I don't think I want to see any... earthy wombs. But thank you for your offer.~
