@0    = ~...I'm not sure I understand you, gnome.~
@1    = ~What T'viy's saying is that this GLOW and RADIANCE are beyond STUPID. You should turn it off! NOW.~
@2    = ~This isn't something I can turn off. That is how I am. This is me. My heritage. My blood.~
@3    = ~Agh! You are an ABOMINATION then, and an icon of STUPIDITY. Only a fool would CRAWL through life in SUCH light!~
@4    = ~I am sorry, gnome. For both the glow and because of the fact how troubled you seem to be.~
