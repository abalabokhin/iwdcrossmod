@1    = ~I think you're the first person I know that combines thievery and divine powers.~
@2    = ~Is that so? Well, you already know some divine tricks... Haven't you stolen a heart or two before?~
@3    = ~No and... I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with such jokes. Sorry, but you're pulling a quite personal string.~
@4    = ~I see. Well, I may like dirty tricks, but I'm not cruel. I won't mention it again.~
@5    = ~So, I hope you're not plotting to kill me for saying that joke last time we talked, hmm?~
@6    = ~What? No, of course not. And I do like a good laugh, really, but you mentioned something I don't feel comfortable discussing. But we're fine. You don't need to worry.~
@7    = ~Good to know.~
@8    = ~And I get it. Everyone has this one thing he or she would prefer to keep for his or her own contemplations.~
