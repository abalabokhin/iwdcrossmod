@0    = ~I've been observing your techniques, L'anna, and I must say that I wouldn't be surprised if you defeated me in a duel, if we organized one.~
@1    = ~You know how to use your weapon well and you seem quite strong, too.~
@2    = ~Thank you, Noon. Luckily, I don't think we need to organize any duels. We already fight often and I would rather have something to eat or drink some wine. Especially with those that may have many tales to tell.~
@3    = ~I believe I do. Both mine, and those from back home, told by my friends and my husband. We would quite often sit and exchange tales.~
@4    = ~That sounds like a well-spent time!~
