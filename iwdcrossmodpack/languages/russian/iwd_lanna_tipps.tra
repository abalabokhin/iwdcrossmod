@0    = ~So, what do you think about my magic, L'anna? Isn't it just as amazing as those rituals your god, Mythrien, believes to be worth special protection?~
@1    = ~Your arcane powers are impressive, but they’re not what mythals offer, Tipps. I'm sorry.~
@2    = ~Hmm, does it mean I should prepare some powerful protecting spells and not expect you to help me when I need it?~
@3    = ~The fact your magic isn't the one Mythrien tells me to protect doesn't mean I won't help you, Tipps. We work together. We are companions, aren't we?~
@4    = ~We are, but what happens if you're to save some... mythal-blessed something OR me?~
@5    = ~Such a situation won't happen. We both know it, Tipps.~
@6    = ~That's a lot of hair on your head. It’s quite curly, too. Perhaps I should use magic to tame those wild things!~
@7    = ~I would appreciate it if you stayed away from my hair, Tipps. Thank you.~
