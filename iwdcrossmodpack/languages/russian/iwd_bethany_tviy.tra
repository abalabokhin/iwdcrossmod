@1    = ~No offense, but you are a bit like this weird little rat, T'viy.~
@2    = ~Uh? You understand LITTLE, girl! And not a rat... more like a MOLE. A MAJESTIC MOLE! One that digs deep! Mhm...~
@3    = ~Right... This may be a bit too deep for me. So I'll just take a step back and... say nothing more to you. Weirdo.~
