@0    = ~Oh, it looks like you can control powers of nature, in a way. I know how to use that natural stuff, too. I had to learn it, I kinda hoped it's going to help with my... "ghastly" problem.~
@1    = ~Hmm? Oh, these powers are so much different. My power is different. It's more unique! And in a way, more personal, one could say.~
@2    = ~Right... I can see it's somewhat important for you to stress how unique it is.~
@3    = ~Because it is and why should I pretend it's anything close to what you can do.~
@4    = ~Fine, fine. I won't compare our powers ever again, yeesh.~
@5    = ~I need some handkerchief. Does anyone have one? Please...?~
@6    = ~Ugh, you can be quite a nuisance, Bethany. Just stuff something up those nostrils and let us move on, will you?~
@7    = ~Gods, you are so damn MEAN.~
