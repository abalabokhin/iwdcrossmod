@0    = ~Ugh, you smell like good elves. That's DISGUSTING.~
@1    = ~I'm disgusting? Well, that's good to know. I'm wondering what you are. The master of... the Reversed Aesthetic?~
@2    = ~I donâ€™t understand why won't you just return to your underground tunnels or hide under a rock like a bug. With which you clearly have more in common than with <PLAYER1>.~
@3    = ~LAUGH while you still can, elf, but you will see you were wrong about T'viy and what he represents.~
@4    = ~Now GO. T'viy has better things to do than wasting his precious time on some light-loving elf!~
