@1    = ~Hah! 'Cause you fear dark any strong halflings like myself? Hahaha!~
@2    = ~No, because I fear you'd cause an infestation of fleas in my store.~
@3    = ~Seriously, that wouldn't really surprise me.~
@4    = ~You know, sometimes I wonder who would willingly worship someone like Bhaal. It sounds kind of insane.~
@5    = ~Hah! Perhaps I'm a bit insane myself! And you can't do a thing about it, missy. I'll keep fightin' and servin' whoever I want. Somethin' wrong about that?~
@6    = ~Well, it's kinda wrong when it's all about pain, and murder, and other stuff like that, but... fine. I'll just pretend I don't know who I am.~
@7    = ~...and I REALLY hope that once this adventure is finished, I will never ever meet again.~
@8    = ~Like seriously. Because who'd want to keep you around?! Well, excluding <CHARNAME>, for some weird reason.~
