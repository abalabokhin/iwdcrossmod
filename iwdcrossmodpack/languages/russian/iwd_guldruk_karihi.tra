@0    = ~You are quite a withered old soul, are you not? Were I to be of your age one day, I would be living out my final days in comfort by the hearth, not combating the frigid nightmare of this land.~ [C0BLANK]
@1    = ~These aching bones may indeed agree with you, young Karihi. But, hard as it may seem to believe, I felt a strange calling... one final journey, my heart spoke, and I would discover something that would pain me to miss.~
@2    = ~Hm! The delusions of an aging mind, no doubt. You would risk your final years on simple faith?~
@3    = ~Aye, foolish as it sounds. But, when you carried your sword for as long as I have, it is no easy task to simply put it down. Not when there is always the choice to raise it once more for another tale in the making.~
@4    = ~Assuming you live to the end of that tale.~
@5    = ~I have walked close to the embrace of death more times than you can count, my girl. Yet I always made the choice to approach, again and again, knowing the next may be the last. But there is power in being capable of making that choice, dangerous as it is. And not all men, nor women, can try to claim the same.~
@6    = ~You are insinuating something, no doubt. Alas, I have neither the time nor the curiosity to make sense of your doddering words.~
@7    = ~Heh, of course. Disregard the meaningless ramblings of this old man, if you will.~
