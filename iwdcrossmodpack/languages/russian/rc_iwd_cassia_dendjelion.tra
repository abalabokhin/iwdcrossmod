@0    = ~I saw how much fun the last kill brought you! No matter who we fight, such pleasure is sickening. For you, it's nothing else but building a pile of dead bodies for your disgusting god Bhaal, isn't it? Don't even try to deny it.~
@1    = ~What's there to deny, eh? At least I accept who I am and what I want to do.~
@2    = ~And I don't care if I am killing damn yetis, wolves, or men and women who decided to get in my way. They are no saints, and neither are you, girl. You could even say I am treating them equally.~
@3    = ~Stop this! I am done with you. You are a wicked man, a pathetic murderer. I will no longer listen to this.~
@4    = ~Oh, are you going to cut off your ears? Or just finally leave me and <PLAYER1> to our mission?~
@5    = ~Perhaps there is no way for us to work together.~
@6    = ~<PLAYER1>, there is no companionship without some trust and I can never trust him. His presence, it... it makes me doubt your decision. This should be resolved.~
@7    = ~Cassia, I need you here. You should stay. Dandjelion... you're on your own.~
@8    = ~You're making a huge deal out of Dendjelion and who he is. I think it's you who should leave, Cassia.~
@9    = ~Eh? You're on her side? Seriously?~
@10   = ~You heard <PRO_HISHER> decision, blackguard.~
@11   = ~I hope the next enemy you both meet, spits on your dead faces, before taking a piss on them. Iâ€™m outta here.~
@12   = ~You heard the boss.~
@13   = ~If that's what you want... I am not going to try and change your mind. However, I hope you will realize that you are making a huge mistake by letting him stay, <PLAYER1>.~
@14   = ~I won't start another fight right now, out of respect to you, but... You shouldn't let that Bhaalite go and hurt more people.~
