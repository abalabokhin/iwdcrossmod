@1    = ~I certainly didn't know I would exchange my solitude for a priest of Mask. And I must say I find your religion a bit... troublesome.~

@4    = ~I'm doing my best here, turning all of it into something less problematic.~
@5    = ~Well... I must say there is something amusing in thinking that you could make doubt go away by talking about dance.~
@6    = ~Amusing? Hah! Well, it looks like it served the purpose then.~
